# J124 – Final Project: An Analysis of CalFresh College Student Data

## The Story 

On the national level, college students are experiencing shocking rates of food insecurity. A 2018 report by the Federal Government Accountability Office found that approximately two million at-risk students who were potentially eligible to enroll in SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) did not receive benefits from the program. 

In California, the outlook is no different. A report by the Legislative Analyst’s Office (LAO) found that a staggering 44% of undergraduate and 26% of graduate students in California experience food insecurity.

According to the 2020 CalFresh Student Data Report by the California Department of Social Services, only as little as 18% of eligible college students are enrolled in the state’s SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), CalFresh. A range of roadblocks prevents students in the state from accessing CalFresh (the SNAP for California), from lack of knowledge about their eligibility to difficulty navigating the application process or being ineligible to receive benefits. Researchers with the Food Research & Action Center and other food access agencies point to outdated SNAP eligibility requirements as a major obstacle to enrolling in CalFresh, such as the primary requirement that a student work at least 20 hours in order to receive benefits. Although there are numerous exemptions from this requirement that allow students to enroll in CalFresh, the overall enrollment percentages for college students in the program remain low.

The purpose of the story is to shed light on the CalFresh eligibility requirements that many students meet without even knowing it. It also aims to highlight who CalFresh reaches across California colleges and universities and why the program must continue to be built upon.

## Sourcing – the _What_ and the _Who_ 
#### Primary Data Source
+ **[California Community College and University of California student participation in CalFresh food benefits](https://www.capolicylab.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Student-Participation-in-CalFresh.pdf)**
    * This is the primary document from which the datasets in this project were parsed.
    
#### Secondary Sources 
1) **[CalFresh Student Data Report](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/Portals/9/Leg/202006-SB-77-CalFresh-Student-Data-Report.pdf)**
    * This report provides information that may guide my analysis, including the average number of students who receive CalFresh benefits per year,  estimated numbers of students who are eligible to enroll in CalFresh, and the percentage of students who are enrolled in the program. 
2) **[CalFresh For College Students: Equitable and Just Access](https://www.cafoodbanks.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/College-CalFresh-WhitePaper-final-March2022.pdf)**
    * This white paper highlights some of the key statistics that provide context for the story, such as the rates of food insecurity faced by undergraduate and graduate students as well as the causes of limited access to SNAP benefits, like outdated eligibility requirements.

#### Human Sources 
1) **Kyle B.** | <kyle.b_____t@berkeley.edu 
    * Kyle is a 4th-year UC Berkeley student, the recruitment director for a UCB _bridges_ recruitment and retention organization, an MLK Student Union employee, and a CalFresh recipient. Since Kyle is a student enrolled in CalFresh who also works with an organization that is focused on recruiting and retaining students by providing them with resources (like pointers to the Basic Needs Center, which helps students apply for CalFresh) to help them thrive at UC Berkeley, he has a particularly unique perspective to offer.
2) **Ruben Canedo** | <elias_canedo@berkeley.edu)
    * Ruben Canedo is the co-chair of the UC Systemwide Basic Needs Committee and served as the director of the UC Berkeley Basic Needs Center. He is an expert on student food security and also researches college student food access. He would certainly be able contextualize the issue of CalFresh access in the grand scheme of student food insecurity and provide more information on what prevents students from receiving benefits.

## Data Visualization 

The best method of visualizing this specific data is a bar chart since it has few categories and several items that must be compared. In this instance, the percentage of undergraduate students enrolled in CalFresh is the point of comparison.
